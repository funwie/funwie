### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer with strong background in building distributed systems with high performant, scalable APIs that focus on delivering great product experiences. 
<br>
I'm always curious to learn about teams and businesses working on challenging problems to scale existing products or on greenfield projects. 
<br>
If you are building new products, scaling a product, building a tech team, or simply improving an existing solution, then let's talk!
